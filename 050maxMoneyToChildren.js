// You have to distribute the money according to the following rules:

// All money must be distributed.
// Everyone must receive at least 1 dollar.
// Nobody receives 4 dollars.
// Return the maximum number of children who may receive exactly 8 dollars if you distribute the money according to the aforementioned rules. If there is no way to distribute the money, return -1.

const distMoney = function(money, children) {

};

/* Example 1:
Input: money = 20, children = 3
Output: 1
Explanation:
The maximum number of children with 8 dollars will be 1. One of the ways to distribute the money is:
- 8 dollars to the first child.
- 9 dollars to the second child.
- 3 dollars to the third child.
It can be proven that no distribution exists such that number of children getting 8 dollars is greater than 1.
